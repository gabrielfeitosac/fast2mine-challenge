## üß† Architecture & Technical Decisions

- **SQFlite** used for local data persistence.
- Clean Architecture implemented using **DataSources**, **Repositories**, and **UseCases**.
- Folder structure organized according to Clean Architecture: **Features**, **Data**, **Domain**, **Presentation**.
- **GetIt** package used for managing Singleton instances.
- **JsonSerializable** and **JsonAnnotation** packages used to help generate model classes.
- GPS and Step data are stored as JSON in the local database using custom JSON converters.

## üíæ Storage Location

The file generated with the synchronized data is:

- **üìÅ sync_servidor.jsonl**
- **Device path:** `/storage/emulated/0/Download/sync_servidor.jsonl` (Downloads folder)

> To access the file, use tools like Android Studio or the device's own file manager.

## ‚ùì Technical Questions

- Was automatic validation of multiple sequential cycles required? (Repeat the process)
- Is dynamic user import of `.jsonl` files needed? (FilePicker)
- The truck must be stationary for 5 seconds to be in the `IN LOADING QUEUE` step, but on the first reading I don‚Äôt have a previous timestamp to compare ‚Äî which step should be considered?
- Should the app maintain the current step after being closed?
